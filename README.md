# Remove Leading Whitespace
A super simple addon written for the flashcard application [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) I wrote because the dictionary I was using for creating flashcards had a lot of unneeded whitespaces at the beginning of each line.
## Usage
Place the \_\_init\_\_.py file in a seperate folder in the Anki plugin folder. When installed, it will remove whitespace at the beginning of each line in any field named 'Meaning'. You can configure this name to whatever you seem fit in the Python file.

Please note that this plugin is only tested with Anki 2.0 and might not work on later Anki versions.
